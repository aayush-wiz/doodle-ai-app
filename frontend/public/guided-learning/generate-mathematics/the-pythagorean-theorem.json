    "introduction": "The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental and widely recognized principles in mathematics, establishing a crucial relationship between the sides of right triangles. Named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, this theorem has applications spanning geometry, trigonometry, engineering, architecture, and physics. The theorem states that in any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This elegant relationship enables calculation of unknown side lengths and forms the foundation for understanding distance, coordinate geometry, and many practical measurement problems.",

        "content": "The Pythagorean Theorem is expressed mathematically as: a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the two legs (the sides forming the right angle), and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle). This formula reveals that the area of the square constructed on the hypotenuse equals the sum of areas of squares constructed on the two legs. Geometrically, this means if you draw squares on each side of a right triangle, the area of the largest square (on the hypotenuse) equals the combined area of the two smaller squares. This visual representation helps understand why the theorem works: the relationship between areas translates directly to the relationship between side lengths. The theorem only applies to right triangles—triangles with exactly one 90-degree angle. In non-right triangles, this relationship does not hold, which is why verifying the right angle is crucial before applying the theorem. The converse is also true: if a² + b² = c² for three sides of a triangle, then the triangle must be a right triangle with the right angle opposite side c.",

        "content": "While attributed to Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE), evidence suggests the theorem was known to Babylonian and Indian mathematicians centuries earlier. The theorem appears in ancient texts like the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra from India (800-600 BCE) and Babylonian clay tablets. However, Pythagoras and his followers are credited with providing the first rigorous mathematical proof. Over 400 different proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem exist, demonstrating its fundamental importance. One elegant proof uses geometric rearrangement: four copies of the right triangle can be arranged to form a square, with the outer square having area (a+b)² and the inner square having area c². Algebraic manipulation shows (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b², and since the four triangles have total area 2ab, subtracting leaves a² + b² = c². Another classic proof uses similar triangles: dropping an altitude from the right angle creates three similar triangles, and the ratios of corresponding sides establish the relationship. These diverse proof methods illustrate the theorem's deep connections to geometry, algebra, and mathematical reasoning.",

        "content": "The Pythagorean Theorem solves countless real-world problems involving distance, measurement, and spatial relationships. In coordinate geometry, the distance formula between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) derives directly from the theorem: distance = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]. This calculates straight-line distances on maps, navigation routes, and coordinate systems. Construction and carpentry applications include: verifying square corners (3-4-5 triangle method), calculating diagonal measurements, determining roof pitch, and ensuring structural right angles. Navigation uses the theorem to calculate shortest paths: if you travel 3 miles east and 4 miles north, the straight-line distance is √(3² + 4²) = 5 miles. Physics applications include calculating resultant forces, determining displacement vectors, and analyzing projectile motion components. Computer graphics and game development use the theorem for distance calculations, collision detection, and rendering calculations. Surveying and land measurement rely on the theorem to calculate property boundaries and inaccessible distances. The theorem also appears in advanced mathematics: it's fundamental to trigonometry (defining sine and cosine), appears in the law of cosines, and connects to complex numbers through the modulus formula.",

        "heading": "Pythagorean Triples and Special Cases",
        "content": "Pythagorean triples are sets of three positive integers (a, b, c) that satisfy a² + b² = c². The smallest and most famous triple is (3, 4, 5), where 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5². Other common triples include (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), and (7, 24, 25). Primitive Pythagorean triples have no common factors—(3, 4, 5) is primitive, while (6, 8, 10) is not (it's a multiple of 3-4-5). Euclid's formula generates all primitive triples: given positive integers m and n where m > n, m and n are coprime, and one is even, the triple is (m² - n², 2mn, m² + n²). For example, m=2, n=1 gives (3, 4, 5). Multiples of primitive triples create additional triples: multiplying (3, 4, 5) by k gives (3k, 4k, 5k). Special right triangles have specific angle relationships: 45-45-90 triangles have sides in ratio 1:1:√2, while 30-60-90 triangles have sides in ratio 1:√3:2. These special cases simplify calculations and appear frequently in geometry problems. The theorem also extends to higher dimensions: in three dimensions, the distance from origin to point (x, y, z) is √(x² + y² + z²), following the same principle.",
